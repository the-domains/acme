Albert Quesada studied Philosophy and Multimedia Engineering. Trained at the PARTS School in Brussels, he has been pursuing his own artistic vision for years now. In Belgium he researches the law of the spectacle and its relations with the spectator. He is a director, choreographer and dancer. From the world of flamenco to orchestral music, his projects stem from this interest in musical structures.
